# CFA-Express-Mongo-CRUD

#### Challenge:
1. Refactor our mongo-crud app to use controllers for all routes;
2. Add a route to delete an ingredient;
3. Create a new route namespace called /api and create a root route which returns all our ingredient data as json;
4. Create API routes for all CRUD actions.

A NodeJS application created with express to learn how to Create, Remove, Update and Delete posts. Furthermore, we created all the API routes.
