# CFA-Express-Mongo-CRUD

#### Challenge:
1. Refactor our mongo-crud app to use controllers for all routes;
2. Add a route to delete an ingredient;
3. Create a new route namespace called /api and create a root route which returns all our ingredient data as json;
4. Create API routes for all CRUD actions;
5. Use Postman to interact with your app;
6. Add token based authentication.

A NodeJS application created with express to learn how to Create, Remove, Update and Delete posts. All the API routes were created and tested with Postman.

Jsonwebtoken was used for the authentication.
```
npm install jsonwebtoken
```
The documentation from the following repository was used: https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken
